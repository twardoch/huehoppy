Tool to transfer colors between images

https://github.com/twardoch/huehoppy

Currently a temporary implementation that relies on

https://github.com/ImmersiveMediaLaboratory/ColorTransferLib
https://github.com/pengbo-learn/python-color-transfer
https://github.com/dstein64/colortrans


1. Analyze the architecture of the three packages (ColorTransferLib, python-color-transfer, colortrans). 

2. I like the principal organization of ColorTransferLib’s Algorithms collection (and in the Evaluation collection) into separate folders. But I don't like the haphazard way of loading them in the main code of ColorTransferLib. If some dependencies fail to load (for example some torch modules), the whole system fails to load. And if I want to only use the simple numeric methods, I still need to install all the heavy dependencies. 

I’ve written my own code in `work/imagecolortransfer` to access several of these algorithms (and those from the other two packages). But in order to get this to work, I’ve made a complicated installation routine in `work/imagecolortransfer_install`. 

I’d like to write a more seamless, modular and fail-safe system (with graceful failing). I’d like to 

- take over the algorithms from ColorTransferLib’s Algorithms (and optionally also Evaluations)
- port the algorithms from python-color-transfer and from colortrans into a similar format
- make a much more robust and convenient API for using the algorithms (including an easy way to chain the algorithms, that is, apply several in sequence onto the same image data). The API should provide a clean separation between working with the algorithms and between the file I/O and working with image files

Make a comprehensive analysis. Think step by step how we will approach this problem. Don’t write any code yet, but you can write brief pseudocode or steps outline.
